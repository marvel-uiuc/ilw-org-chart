## Overview

This component renders an organization chart based on simple JSON of the organization's
entities. The only required data is the title and parent for each entity. Here's a
minimal example:

```json
{
    "title": "Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs",
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "Administrative Assistant"
        },
        {
            "title": "Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Success and Engagement",
            "children": [
                { "title": "Director, Illinois Leadership Center" },
                { "title": "Director, Minority Student Affairs" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The component renders an org chart to fit into a given space, laying it out automatically
to make it fit as well as possible.
